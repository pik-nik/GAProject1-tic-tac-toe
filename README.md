## The Thought Process 
I started off by creating a wireframe of how I would like to structure my page and initial thoughts.

Next I added functinality to my board such  that for each player and hard coded to get a functional MVP. 

Some issues from my initial wireframe was that I my draw message overwrote my span. An initial fix was to rewrite my message such that the player number was at the end but this required me to manually change the visibility of the player. 

After my MVP was submitted- I removed the hard coded comment so that the comment can be adjusted in the javascript. 

## The Final Product
